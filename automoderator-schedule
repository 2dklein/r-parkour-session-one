    Alright this week is going to focus on move combinations and flow practice. We can spend a lot of time breaking things down into individual moves to learn their intricacies, but don’t forget to practice stitching it all together. To complete this challenge, pick two or three different movements and work to chain them together. Then, figure out how to make the transitions seamless- one movement’s ending momentum is the next one’s starting momentum.
