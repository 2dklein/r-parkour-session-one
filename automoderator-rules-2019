 Your submission does not have a [tag]. All posts **must include a tag in the title** or it will be automatically removed. Titles cannot be modified after posting. Include a tag by typing one of the following into the post title with **square brackets** as shown (not case-sensitive). Here are the available tags:  

 ### Media or text post tags:
 - NEW: **[Jam]** is for Parkour gyms, certified instructors, or established groups to post about any upcoming jams in their areas. Send us a modmail to verify the jam and get on the whitelist.
 - NEW: **[Spots]** is a tag for requesting training locations or gyms in a specific area. You must include the location in the title!
 - **[Discuss]** is used for blogs, vlogs, podcasts, technical videos, tutorials, or text posts where you would like to start a topic of conversation.
 - **[Tech]** is used for videos that showcase movement you want advice and help with. The tag could also be used on a text post where you detail the problems you are having, but videos are better for receiving feedback!
 - **[Other]** is a miscellaneous tag that you can post animal Parkour, unique experiences, still photos, non-Parkour movement, whatever. It's the most lenient tag but please don't abuse it.

 ### Video-only tags:
 - **[FR]** is used for any show reels or training videos that you want to share.
 - **[PK]** is reserved for training videos where **at least 80% of the movement (1 out of 5)** is focused on traversing your environment efficiently.

 #### Examples of titles with tags:
 - Does anyone know of any [spots] in London?
 - XYZPK is having a [jam] this weekend 01/20 in Melbourne
 - Can someone help me with my roll \[tech\]?
 - [\[Discuss\] What is the Natural Method?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0V6aUjRjUQ)
 - [\[PK\] Parkour, Literally by L'Inconsolable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMppD-bUNWo)
 - [Advanced freerunning vaults in slow motion \[FR\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UII_PZ3_Rc4)
 - [\[Other\] Here's a repost of a cat jumping!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/comments/c8sg76/the_way_this_cat_jumps/)
